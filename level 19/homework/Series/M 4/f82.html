    <p>On 25 September 2013, BMW released the technical specifications of the M4. It is powered by the S55B30 engine,<br> which is developed and engineered by BMW M GmbH. This 3.0-litre inline-6 engine has been built specifically<br> for the new M4/M3, having a redline of 7,600 rpm with the rev limiter actuated at 7,300 rpm. The engine uses two<br> mono-scroll turbochargers with a peak boost pressure of 18.1 psi (1.2 bar). The power is rated at 317 kW (431 PS; 425 hp),<br> however this is achieved not at a specific engine speed, but is instead rated throughout the range of 5,500–7,300 rpm.<br> The engine's torque is rated at 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft) throughout the range of 1,850–5,500.</p>

    <p>In early 2017, BMW announced M4 CS in limited run of 3,000 units globally with 1,000 units being delivered to the United States.<br> The M4 CS sits between the M4 Competition Package and the M4 GTS. The M4 CS utilizes the same engine as the standard M4 but gets<br> a 9 hp boost from the M4 Competition Package, and generates 338 kW (460 PS; 453 hp) and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque. The M4 CS<br> gets a total boost of 28 hp from its first generation (2014). The car features a light weight interior which trims 35 lb (16 kg) off the weight<br> of the M4 Competition. This is done in part through the use of "compacted natural fiber" interior door panels with fabric latch pulls as seen <br>in the M4 GTS, light weight M sport seats, and the removal of the central arm rest.</p>
