    <p>The M3 version of the F30 3 Series was designated the F80 and was produced from 2014 to 2018. The F80 M3<br> was powered by the BMW S55 twin-turbocharged straight-six engine, therefore being the first turbocharged M3<br> model. Despite the smaller displacement than the V8 engine used by the previous generation of M3, the switch<br> from naturally aspirated engines to turbocharging resulted in peak power being increased from 309 to 317 kW<br> (420 to 431 PS; 414 to 425 hp), and peak torque being increased from 400 to 550 N⋅m (295 to 406 lb⋅ft).</p>

    <p>The S55 engine is the high performance version engine developed from the N55<br> engine by BMW M. It was introduced in the F80 M3, F82 M4 and later to the F87<br> M2 Competition/CS, replacing the BMW S65 naturally aspirated V8 engine used <br>in the previous generation M3.</p>
