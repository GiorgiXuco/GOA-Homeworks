    <p>In July 2006, one year after the saloon was introduced, the E92 coupé body style was unveiled.<br>
       Compared with previous generations of the 3 Series, the coupé has more external styling differences<br> to the saloon models. These include the tail-light design (L-shaped on the coupe), more steeply<br> angled headlights and smaller side windows. As per its E46 predecessor, the doors of the coupe are<br> longer and have frameless door windows, the rear seat holds two passengers (compared with a <br>three-person bench for the saloon) with a rear centre console tray and the front seatbelts are on motorised<br> arms that extend from the B-pillar to hand the seatbelts to the driver and/or passenger.
       The E92 was the last<br> generation to include coupé (and convertible) body styles as a part of the 3 Series range. For later generations,<br> these body styles are marketed as the 4 Series. Despite the E90/E91 being phased out for the F30/F31 after the<br> 2011 model year, the E92/E93 continued through the 2013 model year. It was then succeeded by the F32/F33<br> for the 2014 model year..</p>
