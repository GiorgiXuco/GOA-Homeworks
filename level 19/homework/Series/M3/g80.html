    <p>The BMW M3 is a high-performance version of the BMW 3 Series, developed by BMW's in-house motorsport <br>division, BMW M GmbH. M3 models have been produced for every generation of 3 Series since the E30 M3<br> was introduced in 1986.</p>

    <p>The E30 M3 used the BMW S14 four-cylinder engine, a high-revving DOHC design with<br> a head closely based on that of the BMW S38 six-cylinder engine and the block from the <br>BMW M10 four-cylinder engine with a 7,250 rpm redline. In countries where the M3 was<br> sold with a catalytic converter, the initial versions were rated at 143 kW (195 PS; 192 hp)<br> and had a top speed of 235 km/h (146 mph). In countries where a catalytic converter <br>was not fitted, the engine was rated at 147 kW (200 PS; 197 hp).</p>
