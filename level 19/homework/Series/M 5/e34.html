    <p>The BMW E34 is the third generation of the BMW 5 Series, which was produced from 2 November<br> 1987, until 1996. Initially launched as a saloon in January 1988, the E34 also saw a "Touring" station<br> wagon (estate) body style added in September 1992, a first for the 5 Series. BMW replaced the E34<br> with the E39 5 Series in December 1995, although E34 Touring models remained in production until June 1996.</p>
