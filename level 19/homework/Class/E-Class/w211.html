    <p>E 55 came with an AMG tuned Airmatic suspension with 3 different driving modes as well<br> as the ability to significantly raise the car. The E 55 features 14.2 in (360 mm) cross drilled<br> disc brakes at the front with 8 piston calipers. The rear brakes consist of 13-inch (330 mm)<br> discs and 4 piston calipers.

    <p>This engine had a high-pressure die-cast alloy cylinder block with twin-wire arc spray coated running surfaces.<br> Compression ratio is 11.3:1. According to many auto journalists, the E 63 AMG was one of the quickest production<br> sports sedans in the world. Both the sedan (saloon) and wagon had a 0–60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of<br> 4.3 seconds. Compared to the previous E 55 AMG, the E 63 AMG had more horsepower but less torque, enabling it<br> to be mated to the newer 7G-Tronic automatic transmission.</p>
