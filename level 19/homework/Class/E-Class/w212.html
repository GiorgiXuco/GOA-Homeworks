    <p>The W212 and S212 Mercedes-Benz E-Class series is the fourth generation of the E-Class range<br> of executive cars which was produced by Mercedes-Benz between 2009 and 2016 as the successor<br> to the W211 E-Class. The body styles of the range are either four-door sedan/saloon (W212) or<br> a five-door estate/wagon (S212). Coupé and convertible models of the E-Class of the same generation<br> are W204 C-Class based and known as the C207 and A207, replacing the CLK-Class (C209 and A209)<br> coupé and cabriolet. A high-performance E 63 AMG version of the W212 and S212 were available as well<br> since 2009. In 2013, a facelift was introduced for the E-Class range, featuring significant styling changes, fuel<br> economy improvements and updated safety features.</p>

    <p>In 2011, the 6.2-litre V8 was replaced by a twin-turbo version of the 5.5-litre V8<br> available in the E 500/E 550; power remained the same as for the earlier, naturally<br> aspirated 6.2-litre engine. There was also a 557 PS (410 kW; 549 hp) Performance<br> Pack version. In October 2013, the AMG S model of the E 63 was introduced;<br> this version has 585 PS (430 kW; 577 hp) and replaces the earlier Performance Pack model.<br>In the United States, the E 63 station wagon is only available as an AMG S, and all E 63s sold<br> in North America now receive the 4Matic system as standard. Meanwhile, power of the "regular"<br> E 63 AMG increased to the same level as the previous</p>
