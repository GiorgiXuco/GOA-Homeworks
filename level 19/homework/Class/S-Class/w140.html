    <p>The Mercedes-Benz W140 is a series of flagship vehicles manufactured by Mercedes-Benz from 1991 to 1998 <br>in sedan/saloon and coupe body styles and two wheelbase lengths (SE and SEL). Mercedes-Benz unveiled the <br>W140 S-Class at Geneva International Motor Show in March 1991, with the sales starting in April 1991 and <br>North American launch was on 6 August 1991.</p>

    <p>For the W140 series, a new generation of inline-6 and V8 petrol engines was developed<br> with double-overhead camshafts (DOHC), four valves per cylinder, and new variable<br> valve timing. Mercedes-Benz's first passenger V12 engine was introduced in 1991 in<br> a response to BMW's 750i/750iL (E32). Only the 3.5-litre inline-6 diesel engine, OM 603.97x,<br> was carried over from W126, and it remained the only engine in the W140 model range with<br> a two-valves-per-cylinder format until its replacement in 1996. The advent of DOHC, with four<br> valves per cylinder and accompanied by variable valve timing, helped to increase the horsepower <br>and torque figures without imposing a heavy fuel-consumption penalty, all while reducing emissions.<br> All petrol engines were equipped with catalytic converters during the entire W140 model run, <br>regardless of where they were sold.</p>
