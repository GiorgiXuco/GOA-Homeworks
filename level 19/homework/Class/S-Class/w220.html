    <p>The Mercedes-Benz W220 was a range of flagship sedans which, as the fourth generation Mercedes-Benz<br> S-Class, replaced the W140 S-Class after model year 1998 — with long and short wheelbase versions,<br> performance and luxury options; available four-wheel drive; and a range of diesel as well as gas/petrol<br> V6, V8, and V12 engines. Compared to its predecessor, the W220 had somewhat smaller exterior dimensions<br> but offered greater interior volume, particularly in the long-wheelbase versions, and slightly less cargo volume.</p>

    <p>The S 55 AMG is a high performance version of the S-Class with a number of performance oriented<br> modifications over the stock W220. The model name derives from displacement of the engine, an almost<br> 5.5 litre V8. The early model had a naturally aspirated version of the engine with 355 hp (265 kW; 360 PS),<br> and starting in 2003, it switched to a supercharged version with 493 hp (368 kW; 500 PS) and 516 lb⋅ft <br>(700 N⋅m) of torque</p>

    <p>The S 600 was the main 12-cylinder engine model of the W220 body. The increased output<br> of the engine enabled this W220 to keep up with a Ferrari 575M Maranello according to one<br> automotive magazine of the era. The 2003 S 600 could achieve 60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.3 seconds<br> and 100 mph (161 km/h) in 9.7 seconds. It was 1/10 second faster than the Ferrari in a quarter<br> mile test, with the S 600 achieving in 12.5 seconds at 115 mph (185 km/h). It could stop from 70 mph <br>(110 km/h) in 164 feet with the OEM tires in that same testing. The 2003 model was fitted with Michelin<br> Pilot Sport tires with a Y rating. In the US, the 2001 S 600 had a 5.8 liter V-12 making 362 hp (270 kW; 367 PS)<br> at 5500 rpm and up to 391 lb⋅ft (530 N⋅m) of torque at 4100 rpm. The 2003 model update had a 5.5<br> liter V-12 with twin turbochargers, producing 493 hp (368 kW; 500 PS) and 590 lb⋅ft (800 N⋅m) of torque.</p>
