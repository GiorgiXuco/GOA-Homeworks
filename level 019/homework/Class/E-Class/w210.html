    <p>The Mercedes-Benz W210 is the internal designation for a range of executive cars manufactured by<br> Mercedes-Benz and marketed under the E-Class model name in both sedan/saloon (1995–2002) and <br>station wagon/estate (1996–2003) configurations. W210 development started in 1988, three years after<br> the W124's introduction.
    The W210 was designed by Steve Mattin under design chief Bruno Sacco <br>between 1988 and 1991, later being previewed on the 1993 Coupé Concept shown at the Geneva Auto<br> Show in March 1993. The W210 was the first Mercedes-Benz production car featuring Xenon headlamps<br> (including dynamic headlamp range control, only low beam).</p>
