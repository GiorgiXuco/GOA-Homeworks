    <p>The F90 M5 is based on the G30 5 Series and uses an all-wheel drive ("xDrive") powertrain,<br> being the first time that an M5 has not been rear-wheel drive. However the all-wheel drive system<br> is biased towards the rear wheels. It can also be configured to send power to the rear wheels only,<br> if the electronic stability control (ESC) is disabled. The transmission is an 8-speed ZF GA8HP75Z automatic.</p>
