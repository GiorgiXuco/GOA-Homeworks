    <p>The BMW E39 is the fourth generation of the BMW 5 Series range of executive cars, which was manufactured<br> from 1995 to 2004. It was launched in the saloon body style, with the station wagon body style (marketed as "Touring")<br> introduced in 1996. The E39 was replaced by the E60 5 Series in 2003, however E39 Touring models remained in production until May 2004.</p>

    <p>At launch, the petrol engines consisted of the BMW M52 straight-6 engines and the BMW M62 V8 engines.<br> In late 1998, the "technical update" (TÃœ) versions of these engines were introduced, introducing double VANOS to the M52 and<br> single VANOS to the M62, primarily to increase torque at low rpm.</p>
