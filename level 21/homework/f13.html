    <p>The official performance figures state the acceleration time from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph)<br> in 4.2 seconds for the coupe and Gran Coupé, and 4.3 seconds for the convertible. The top <br>speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), or 305 km/h (190 mph) with the<br> optional M-driver's package. The differential is an electronically actuated ("Active M") limited <br>slip differential. The curb weight for the coupe is 1,850 kg (4,070 lb). The curb weight of the<br> convertible is 2,055 kg (4,531 lb), and the curb weight of the Gran Coupé is 1,950 kg (4,299 lb).<br>
    The front of the car has a newly designed M kidney grille with an “M6” badge – a homage to <br>the first generation of the M6. The lead exterior designer of the F12/F13/F06 6 Series was Nader Faghihzadeh.</p>
